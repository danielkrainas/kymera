# Kymera

Kymera is an exploratory project into developing a frontend framework that incorporates many promising and emerging technologies as well as incorporating some concepts that just seem to work as in the case of pipes & filters approach within ExpressJS. 

**Please Note:** This code is really just a test bench right now and nothing more. This means that it may or may not work at any point and I make no guarantees to the "tidiness" or general state of things... for now :]

## Design Goals

- Main features: components, services, 
- Use ShadowDOM and Web Components API for component feature.
- Incorporate Pipes & Filters pattern for traditional controller-based logic.
- Use CQ(RS) pattern with controller pipeline?
    - not sure if this will be a good solution or if a better way will pop up as the code matures.
- Use DI all around.
    - makes testing a breeze.
- Promises as first-class citizens?
- Service/provider/factory concept from Angular.
    - it's a great way to organize complex code and leverage these common patterns.
- Virtual DOM for perf?
    - not entirely sure if this will be needed at this point.
- Core framework can work on server.
- Server side rendering of components as with ReactJS.
- Very little "ceremony" during setup.

## Contributions

I'm not really expecting this to become a full-fledged project but if you would like to contribute an idea or code, post an issue or create a PR and I'll see about merging it.
